          Designing user experiences is as much about understanding psychology as it is about visual aesthetics.
          Effective UX anticipates how users think, feel, and behave to create intuitive and engaging digital products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cognitive load theory reminds us that users can process only a limited amount of information at once, so simplicity is key.
          Color theory influences emotions and perceptions, helping guide users’ attention and actions.

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Behavioral design techniques include:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>Using visual hierarchy to prioritize information</li>
          <li>Applying feedback loops that reinforce user actions</li>
          <li>Designing for accessibility and inclusivity</li>
          <li>Leveraging microinteractions to delight users</li>
